### Hi there, I'm Priyansh Jajoo 👋

**Researcher @ Technuf | Computer Vision & Media Forensics**

I am a Researcher and Data Scientist focused on the **Generalization Crisis** in Generative AI. Unlike traditional analysts who focus on business KPIs, my work centers on **Adversarial Robustness** and **Signal Consistency** in deepfake detection. I am currently transitioning from industry to doctoral research to develop physics-based defenses against synthetic media.

🔭 **Current Research Focus**
- **Deepfake Detection:** Investigating the "Forensic Triad" (Attribution, Localization, Explanation).
- **Adversarial Defense:** Analyzing how state-of-the-art detectors fail against simple signal processing attacks.
- **Survey Work:** Lead author of *"Adversarial Robustness in DeepFake Detection: A Comprehensive Survey"* (Submitted to Springer, 2025).

🛠 **Technical Arsenal**
- **Deep Learning:** PyTorch, TensorFlow, Transformers (HuggingFace), CNNs (ResNet, EfficientNet).
- **Computer Vision:** OpenCV, Albumentations, FFT/DCT Analysis.
- **Data Engineering:** Python (Pandas, Dask), SQL, Snowflake, AWS.

🚀 **Selected Projects**

**1. Adversarial Robustness in Media Forensics** (Active)
*Current research at Technuf.*
- Investigating the fragility of Foundation Model detectors against Gaussian noise and compression attacks.
- **Key Output:** Identified a 40% performance drop in ViT-based detectors under adversarial perturbation.

**2. Canadian Macroeconomic Forecasting (ARIMA/RF)**
- Rigorous time-series analysis of 60+ years of economic data.
- **Methodology:** Compared ARIMA (Statistical) vs. Random Forest (ML) to model GDP drivers.
- **Result:** Achieved 98.9% accuracy, demonstrating strong statistical modeling capabilities.
